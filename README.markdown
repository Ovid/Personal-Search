# DESCRIPTION

This is a way of helping me learn HTML5, CSS and Javascript better. It's just
a shorthand for several common searches I like to do, without having to go to
the pages and constantly clicking "advanced search". Further, it should work
regardless of where I am and which browser I am using. Long-term plans involve
creating custom search bookmarks.

# HTML5

Long-term I intend to take advantage of localStorage, so I have issues with
using HTML5 now, though I do try to degrade gracefully.

# ALPHA

This is only a proof of concept. In fact, it's fair to say that this code
sucks.
