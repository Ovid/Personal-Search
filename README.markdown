# NAME

Personal-Search - Search what you really want to search

# VERSION

Version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

Point your browser at search.html and go.

# DESCRIPTION

This is a way of helping me learn HTML5, CSS and Javascript better. It's just
a shorthand for several common searches I like to do, without having to go to
the pages and constantly clicking "advanced search".

# HTML5

Long-term I intend to take advantage of localStorage, so I have issues with
using HTML5 now, though I do try to degrage gracefully.

# ALPHA
This is only a proof of concept. In fact, it's fair to say that this code
sucks.
